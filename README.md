## 🧠 How It Works

- A new task is added by typing into the input box and clicking "Add".
- Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them.
- Each task has an `×` button to delete it from the list.
- DOM methods like `createElement`, `appendChild`, `classList.toggle`, and `addEventListener` are used for all interactions.
